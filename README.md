1.	Define an interface which has methods area(), volume(). Define constant PI. Create a class cylinder which implements this interface and calculate area and volume. (Hint: Use define()) 

2.	Write class declarations and member function definitions for an employee (code, name, designation). Design derived classes as emp_account (account_no, joining_date) from employee and emp_sal (basic_pay, earnings, deduction) from emp_account.

3.	Derive a class square from class Rectangle. Create one more class circle. Create an interface with only one method called area(). Implement this interface in all the classes. Include appropriate data members and constructors in all classes. Write a program to accept details of a square, circle and rectangle and display the area.
